This repository contains all the code samples for all tutorials and articles that can be found on our blog and website. The goals and aims behind these tutorials are not only to discuss and provide examples of the great features within in the .net ecosystem, but also to provide you with all the information and illustration code you need to be able to implement these capabilities for yourself right out of the box.

There are several different projects that are organized in sub-folders. These sub-folders are organized similarly to the organization of the docs for .NET. Some of the articles will have more than one sample associated with them. All the code samples and projects are linked to the relevant blog posts and articles that discuss the concepts and solutions relating to them.

The code in this repository represents programs that demonstrate application or library scenarios. These samples often use more than one technology, feature, or toolkit. Each sample has a readme.md file that explains the sample and links to resources for more information.

Samples should be buildable projects. Those projects should build and run on the widest set of platforms possible for the given sample. In practice, that means building .NET Core-based console applications where possible.
